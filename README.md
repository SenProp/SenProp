- 👋 Hi, I’m @SenProp
- 👀 I’m interested in Civ6 mods and why they mess with EUI and crash the gameplay.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular
- 😄 Pronouns: old-fashioned male. I guess that makes me "he/ him". 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been around much longer than most of you. So, forgive me if I am a bit slow.
